      I am a Masters student at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/) who is pursuing a [Masters in Analytics and Management](https://www.london.edu/masters-degrees/masters-in-analytics-and-management). I pursued an Economics undergraduate degree before venturing into Academia; I took up a position as a former research assistant in Marketing and worked on various projects then. 

      I decided to leave Academia and venture into the realm of Analytics and Consultancy in hopes of developing my potential at making an impact on society.

          During my Masters' industrial attachment in London, I led an ethnically (from 6 countries) and professionally (from computer science, economics, and consulting) diverse team to work with Harrod’s Insights Analytics and Data team on a persona lifecycle analysis project. The findings were eventually presented to their senior management.
          
          - Expanded upon the existing static company-adopted persona K-medoids clustering model to allow internal
          stakeholders to determine a correct time to re-assign accurate personas to customers
          - Feature engineered early predictors of key customer personas – new customers with 4 months of data are now at
          least 5 times more likely to be correctly assigned initial personas – and delivered specific marketing campaign

          I was a researcher at the National University of Singapore (NUS) working on the [NUS SPIRE Project](https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/spire/), an inter-discplinary study spanning across the Economics, Marketing and Sociology fields.

          - Served as the main econometric analyst for a 4-year long inter-disciplinary project studying the rise of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1940s where I performed quantitative data analysis using econometric and statistical models
            - Used conditional logit regression, spatial regression and mediation analysis via programming software STATA and R

          I was supposed to intern here as a Transaction segmentation analyst. However, I was told after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic that due to the uncertainty of the situation, RMS would be cancelling the internship opportunity.

          - While I may have missed an opportunity to intern here as an analyst, this was essentially my first step into the world of analytics
          - I took the opportunity to learn the Python language and read up on techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Natural Language Processing in preparation for the internship
          - It was also thanks to this stint that I decided to venture into Machine Learning and Predictions in my final undergraduate year; this also kickstarted my journey into analytics and contributed to my current decision to do a Masters in Business Analytics

          - Extracted overarching themes found in qualitative responses, of 19 life insurance companies, to a parallel run survey comprising 20 unique questions
            - Results obtained could allow the central bank to more effectively understand challenges faced by life insurers and thereby redesign its approach when working with them

        content: In this essay, I explore the philosophy behind the classic film Blade Runner, positing that the romantic self lies at the heart of Blade Runner’s film noir, first born through the film’s dystopia, then evinced by the juxtaposition of differing selfhoods through character development, and finally immortalised in the dramatic confrontation between Batty and Deckard.
