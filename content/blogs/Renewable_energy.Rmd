# Challenge 2: Share of renewable energy production in the world

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a a very interesting
dataset on the adoption of about 200 technologies in more than 150
countries since 1800. This is the[Cross-country Historical Adoption of
Technology (CHAT)
dataset](https://www.nber.org/research/data/cross-country-historical-adoption-technology).

The following is a description of the variables

| **variable** | **class** | **description**                |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| variable     | character | Variable name                  |
| label        | character | Label for variable             |
| iso3c        | character | Country code                   |
| year         | double    | Year                           |
| group        | character | Group (consumption/production) |
| category     | character | Category                       |
| value        | double    | Value (related to label)       |

```{r,load_technology_data}

technology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-19/technology.csv')

#get all technologies
labels <- technology %>% 
  distinct(variable, label)

# Get country names using 'countrycode' package
technology <- technology %>% 
  filter(iso3c != "XCD") %>% 
  mutate(iso3c = recode(iso3c, "ROM" = "ROU"),
         country = countrycode(iso3c, origin = "iso3c", destination = "country.name"),
         country = case_when(
           iso3c == "ANT" ~ "Netherlands Antilles",
           iso3c == "CSK" ~ "Czechoslovakia",
           iso3c == "XKX" ~ "Kosovo",
           TRUE           ~ country))

#make smaller dataframe on energy
energy <- technology %>% 
  filter(category == "Energy")

# download CO2 per capita from World Bank using {wbstats} package
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC
co2_percap <- wb_data(country = "countries_only", 
                      indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC", 
                      start_date = 1970, 
                      end_date = 2022,
                      return_wide=FALSE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  #drop unwanted variables
  select(-c(unit, obs_status, footnote, last_updated))

# get a list of countries and their characteristics
# we just want to get the region a country is in and its income level
countries <-  wb_cachelist$countries %>% 
  select(iso3c,region,income_level)

```

This is a very rich data set, not just for energy and CO2 data, but for
many other technologies. In our case, we just need to produce a couple
of graphs-- at this stage, the emphasis is on data manipulation, rather
than making the graphs gorgeous.

First, produce a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest %
contribution of renewables in energy production. This is made up of
`elec_hydro`, `elec_solar`, `elec_wind`, and `elec_renew_other`. You may
want to use the *patchwork* package to assemble the two charts next to
each other.


[**2019 data**]

```{r renewables proportion}
# Create country's proportion of total energy production that stems from renewable sources
# We used 2019 data only

renewables_summary <- energy %>%
  select(-label) %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>% #Transform to wide form dataset
  mutate(renewables_proportion = round((elec_hydro + elec_solar + elec_wind + elec_renew_other) / elecprod, 3) * 100) %>% #Create proportion variable.  Take note that we round to 3 here to perfectly replicate the graph shown above. Any other value will return a slightly different plot
  arrange(desc(renewables_proportion)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(renewables_proportion > 0)

# Extract top 20 countries by renewable energy proportion
top_20_renewables <- renewables_summary %>% 
  slice_max(n = 20, order_by = renewables_proportion)

# Extract bottom 20 countries by renewable energy proportion  
bottom_20_renewables <- renewables_summary %>% 
  slice_min(n = 20, order_by = renewables_proportion)

# Store a plot of top 20 countries reordered on proportion
top_20_plot <- ggplot(top_20_renewables, aes(x = renewables_proportion, y = fct_reorder(country, renewables_proportion))) +
  geom_col(orientation = "y")  +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = str_wrap("Highest % of renewables in energy production", 30), x = "Percent") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))

# Store a plot of bottom 20 countries reordered on proportion
bottom_20_plot <- ggplot(bottom_20_renewables, aes(x = renewables_proportion, y = fct_reorder(country, renewables_proportion))) +
  geom_col(orientation = "y")  +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = str_wrap("Lowest % of renewables in energy production", 30), x = "Percent") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))

# Use patchwork package to create comparison plot
top_20_plot + bottom_20_plot +
  plot_annotation(title = "Highest and lowest % of renewables in energy production",
                  subtitle = "2019 data") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12))
  
```

Second, you can produce an animation to explore the relationship between
CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables. As the % of
energy generated by renewables goes up, do CO2 per capita emissions seem
to go down?

[**Answer:**]{.underline}

From observing the animation, 2 features are striking.

The first would be that we observe an inverse relationship between C2
emissions and % renewables; that is, when a larger proportion of a
country's energy production comes from renewable sources, the lower the
CO2 emissions for that country and vice-versa. This is represented by
the points that move along a north-west to south-east line in each of
the income group plots. This can mostly be seen in all facets except
"Low Income"; these countries had CO2 emissions that stayed pretty much
constant no matter how their % renewables changed.

The second pattern we notice is that for countries in the High Income
group, there exist a few select countries in which % renewable energy
production proportion remained relatively constant despite CO2 emissions
fluctuating drastically (CO2 emissions changed perhaps due to compliance
to climate change regulations); these are also the same countries with
the highest CO2 emissions amongst all other countries. Likewise, many
other countries changed the extent to which they relied on renewable
energy in their energy output but had no change to CO2 emissions; these
were mainly countries with relatively lower CO2 emissions to begin with.
This pattern implies that, for these countries, there exists almost no
correlation between CO2 per cap and % renewables across time.


To create this animation is actually straight-forward. You manipulate
your date, and the create the graph in the normal ggplot way. the only
`gganimate` layers you need to add to your graphs are

      labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
           x = '% renewables', 
           y = 'CO2 per cap') +
      transition_time(year) +
      ease_aes('linear')

```{r co2 emissions renewables animation}
# Rename columns in co2 dataset for ease
co2_percap <- co2_percap %>% 
  rename(year = date) %>% 
  rename(emissions = value)

# Create full dataset of energy, income and co2 emissions using join functions
energy_income_co2 <- energy %>% 
  left_join(., countries, by = "iso3c") %>% 
  left_join(., select(co2_percap, -c(iso2c, indicator, indicator_id)), by = c("iso3c", "year", "country")) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) #Change year to integer so that the animation correctly reflects yearly change

# Create renewables proportion of countries across years
renewables_proportion_summary <- energy_income_co2 %>%
  select(-label) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>% #Transform to wide data
  select(-c(elec_coal, elec_cons, elec_gas, elec_nuc, elec_oil, electric_gen_capacity)) %>% #ALL GOOD TIL NOW
  group_by(country, year) %>% 
  summarise(renewables_proportion = (elec_hydro + elec_solar + elec_wind + elec_renew_other) / elecprod * 100,
            income_level = first(income_level), n = n(),
            emissions = mean(emissions)) %>%   #Create summary statistics that will be plotted
  filter(!(is.na(income_level))) %>%
  filter(year >= 1990)

# Plot faceted (income level) animation of emissions againsnt renewables proportion across years
ggplot(renewables_proportion_summary, aes(renewables_proportion, emissions, colour = factor(income_level))) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) + #Create scatterplot
  facet_wrap(~ income_level) + #Facet on incomem level
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}',
       x = '% renewables',
       y = 'CO2 per cap') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear') #Animation controls
```

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all
components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same
type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the
variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes.
Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly
and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both
self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used
tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled.
Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled
clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret
the output.
