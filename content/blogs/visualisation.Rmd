# Brexit plot

Using your data manipulation and visualisation skills, please use the Brexit results dataframe (the same dataset you used in the pre-programme assignement) and produce the following plot. Use the correct colour for each party; google "UK Political Party Web Colours" and find the appropriate hex code for colours, not the default colours that R gives you.

```{r brexit_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#load the data into R
brexit_results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostis-christodoulou/am01/master/data/brexit_results.csv")

#gain a first understanding of the dataframe
glimpse(brexit_results)
skim(brexit_results)

#we want to have an overview of how the percentage of the party affilitation is related to the percentage in the brexit voting share. Therefore, we want to create a long table that displays the voting percentage per parliament constituency

#only select the most important information
brexit_results_plot_df <- brexit_results %>% 
  select(-c(born_in_uk, male, unemployed, degree, age_18to24)) %>% 
  #create a longer format dataset
  rename (Conservative = con_2015,
          Labour = lab_2015,
          "Lib Dems" = ld_2015,
          UKIP = ukip_2015) %>% 
   pivot_longer(cols = 2:5,
               names_to = "Party",
               values_to = "Party_share")

ggplot(data = brexit_results_plot_df, aes(x = Party_share, y = leave_share, colour = Party)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.2) + 
  geom_lm(interval = "confidence") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#0087DC", "#E4003B", "#FAA61A", "#6D3177"), name="") +
  ylim(0,100) +
  labs(title = "How political affiliation traanslated to Brexit Voting", 
       y = "Leave % in the 2016 Brexit referendum",
       x = "Party % in the UK 2015 general election") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.position = "bottom")

```

[**NOTE:**]{.underline}

The plot shows several interesting patterns. Generalizing conclusions should made cautiously which is why especially the relationship of the parliament constituencies' share of votes for the labour and/or conservative party and the corresponding leave share votes should not be over interpreted. However, the stronger trends for the Liberal Democrats as well as the Independent Party may show some interesting tendencies. While parliament constituencies in which the vote share for the Liberal Democrats was relatively low showed above 50% vote shares for Brexit, this vote share quickly depletes as the share of Liberal Democrats affiliation increases. An inverse relation with stronger magnitude is to be observed for the UKIP. In underrepresented parliament constituencies the vote share to leave the EU was relatively low but strongly increases as the affiliation to the UKIP grows. At around 20% representation of the UKIP in the parliament constituencies the vote shares were up to 75%. This finding should not come as a surprise, as the main campaign positions of the UKIP was to be independent of the EU whereas the Liberal Democrats campaigned to stay.

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised

```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

# Create long form data
tidy_GDP_data <- UN_GDP_data %>%
  mutate(Shortind = gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)","",as.character(IndicatorName))) %>% #Remove all characters after "(", inclusive
  mutate(Ind_id = gsub("\\b(\\pL)\\pL{2,}|.", "\\U\\1", as.character(Shortind), perl = TRUE)) %>% #Remove all characters after first letter of each word
  relocate(Ind_id, .after = Shortind) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(CountryID, Country, IndicatorName, Shortind, Ind_id), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Values") %>% 
  mutate(Values = Values / 1e9) %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))

# Check that length of unique indicators list matches that of unique short indicators list
indicators <- unique(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName)
shortindicators <- unique(tidy_GDP_data$Shortind)
ind_id <- unique(tidy_GDP_data$Ind_id)

# Create Ind_id to IndicatorName reference table
Indicators_table <- as.data.frame(cbind(ind_id, indicators))

# Check for obserevations with NA values
tidy_GDP_data %>%
  summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.))) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))

# Cursory glance
glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```



```{r GDP Components over time for 3 countries}

variables_of_interest <- c("GCF", "EGAS", "GGFCE", "HCE", "IGAS")

variables_with_descrip <-Indicators_table %>% 
  filter(ind_id %in% variables_of_interest )
  
df <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  select(-c(IndicatorName, Shortind)) %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(Ind_id %in% variables_of_interest)

# Plot components of GDP across time
ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Values, group = Ind_id, colour = factor(Ind_id))) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Country) +
  labs(title = "GDP components over time", subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",x = "Year", y = "Billion US$") +
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Components of GDP", labels = c("Exports", "Gross Capital Formation", "Government Expenditure", "Houesehold Expenditure", "Imports")) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10)) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.5, 'cm'), #change legend key size
        legend.key.height = unit(0.5, 'cm'), #change legend key height
        legend.key.width = unit(0.5, 'cm'), #change legend key width
        legend.title = element_text(size=10), #change legend title font size
        legend.text = element_text(size=8), #change legend text font size
        legend.position = "right")

```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

variables_of_interest2 <- c("GCF", "EGAS", "GGFCE", "HCE", "IGAS","GDP")
variables_proportion <- c("GCF_proportion", "HCE_proportion", "GGFCE_proportion", "NE_proportion", "GDP_delta_proportion")

manual_GDP_df <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  select(-c(IndicatorName, Shortind)) %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(Ind_id %in% variables_of_interest2) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Ind_id, values_from = Values) %>%

  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Components of GDP", labels = c("Gross Capital Formation", "GDP % difference", "Government Expenditure", "Houesehold Expenditure", "Net Exports")) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),

```

[**NOTE:**]{.underline}

As the graphs show, there is a small, but undeniable difference between the sum of all GDP components and the UN reported total GDP value. This might be surprising at first, but as clarified earlier, the calculation of the GDP as the sum of government spending, consumption, investments plus the net exports is rather of a simplistic nature. Simultaneously, it is very difficult to estimate the exact values for each individual component of GDP. We believe that in order to calculate the various components, the UN might have used adjusted values for a better estimate. Similarly, to not be effected by the many assumptions made to calculate the individual components, the UN might have opted to extrapolate the GDP total value based on a different, more rigorous approach.

The graphs do hint at another anomaly. There is a clear difference between the countries in terms of the accuracy of the sum of GDP's components and the UN's reported GDP value. Whilst it seems as if the values for Germany and the United Stated have aligned with the reported GDP amount, the GDP estimate for India remains different until the present day. This might be down to the relatively high quality of data for Germany's and the USA's economy as opposed to the data on India's economy. Therefore, the UN might have been forced to fall back on assumptions and estimations that lead to less accurate representations of the true values.


> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?

These graphs depict some noteworthy differences, similarities and trends. For all three countries, though very different, there is a strong tendency for the trade balance/ net exports to play a small part in the the countries GDP share. However, this does not imply that there are not significant differences in the magnitude of the im- and exports between these countries. Though, it does hint at the fact that despite all three countries having a strong industry (India's natural resources and tech sector, Germany's automobile and chemical industry and USA's oil and automobile sector) all strongly depend on foreign goods to cover their domestic demand. Therefore the net exports' GDP share are almost negligible. Only Germany, who has been up-scaling their exporting of automobiles to eastern countries and especially China has been realizing a positively developing share of net exports.

In the meantime, household spending makes up the largest share of GDP for all countries around the 60% mark. While Germany and the USA have been steady in this area for the last few decades, India has realized a 15% drop in its share. This might be down to an increasing share of household finances being used to spend on foreign goods as the middle class in India grows. Another explanation might be that through the relatively stronger increase in other components of the GDP the household expenditures' share decreases a result.

The investments in India are an exemplary increase that might have caused the share of household expenditures to decrease. India's size and resources make it an interesting trade partner for many other global powers and throughout the last 20 years India has felt an increasing investment in its country. This is observable in especially its tech sector and infrastructure. The growth of companies such as SPAN Infotech and Tata as well foreign investment by China through its silk road initiative are driving forces in this trend.

The government expenditure on the other hand is relatively low in India. USA and Germany have witnessed around 10% higher government expenditure relative to their GDP, as they have more established governmental structures and tax systems as well as social benefit systems that allow as well as require for higher relative government expenditure, respectively.
