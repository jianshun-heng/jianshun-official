<h1>Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing</h1>
<p>Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We
can get the latest data by running the following</p>

<p>The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of
weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks
14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).</p>
<p>For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of
rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each
week/month of 2020-2022 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the
calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>.</p>
<p>We should use the mean to calculate expected rentals. In our case, we
wanted to smooth (by averaging) all of the data, including anomalies,
across the years for rentals within each month/week; this gives a
clearer picture of an “average” for each time period since the median
statistic would automatically exclude the effects of outliers.</p>

<p><u><strong>NOTE:</strong></u></p>
<p>We see that during the beginning of coronavirus lockdown periods, we
observed a notable reduction in bike rentals. Conversely, past the
lifting of general coronavirus measures in mid 2021, we have seen
consistent positive excess rentals compared to the mean 2016-2019 bike
rentals; this suggests that the local population was particularly
inclined to get out of the house and into the fresh air by cycling more
regularly. A similar pattern can be observed for the weekly analysis of
bike rentals; bike rentals by more than 50%, as compared to the period
from 2016-2019, in most weeks after the lockdown measures were lifted.</p>
