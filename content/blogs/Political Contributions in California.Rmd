# Challenge 2: 2016 California Contributors plots

To get this plot, you must join two dataframes; the one you have with all contributions, and data that can translate zipcodes to cities. You can find a file with all US zipcodes, e.g., here <http://www.uszipcodelist.com/download.html>.

The easiest way would be to create two plots and then place one next to each other. For this, you will need the `patchwork` package. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html>

While this is ok, what if one asked you to create the same plot for the top 10 candidates and not just the top two? The most challenging part is how to reorder within categories, and for this you will find Julia Silge's post on [REORDERING AND FACETTING FOR GGPLOT2](https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/) useful.

```{r, load_CA_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Make sure you use vroom() as it is significantly faster than read.csv()
# Load datasets
CA_contributors_2016 <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data","CA_contributors_2016.csv"))

zipcodes <- read_csv(here::here("data", "zip_code_database.csv"))

# Glimpse datasets
glimpse(CA_contributors_2016)
glimpse(zipcodes)

# Join datasets (note that zip types are different across both datasets)
# Therefore we change them to be the same so that the datasets can be joined
CA_contributors_2016$zip<-as.character(CA_contributors_2016$zip)
df <- left_join(CA_contributors_2016, zipcodes, "zip")

# Summarise total contributions raised by the top 10 candidates across every city
top_10_cand_overall <- df %>% 
  group_by(cand_nm) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contb_receipt_amt)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  top_n(10)

# Create long form data to incude only the top 10 candidates
long_form_top10_cand_all_cities <- df %>% 
  filter(cand_nm %in% top_10_cand_overall$cand_nm) %>% 
  group_by(cand_nm, primary_city) %>%
  summarise(total_contrib = sum(contb_receipt_amt))

# From previous dataset, create a table for the top 10 candidates across the top 10 cities
# Incorporate the use of reorder_within to reorder within a group
top_10_cities_per_cand <- long_form_top10_cand_all_cities %>% 
  group_by(cand_nm) %>% 
  top_n(10, total_contrib) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(cand_nm = as.factor(cand_nm),
         primary_city = tidytext::reorder_within(primary_city, total_contrib, cand_nm)) 

# Plot faceted plots for each of the top 10 candidates across their respective top 10 cities
ggplot(top_10_cities_per_cand , aes(total_contrib, primary_city))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = cand_nm), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ cand_nm, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  tidytext::scale_y_reordered() +
  labs(title = "Comparisonn of contribution amounts raised", subtitle = "In which cities did the top 10 candidates raise the most money?", x = "Amount raised", y = "City") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
          axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
          strip.text = element_text(size = 5),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill="lightblue", colour="black", size=1))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = ~ format(.x, scientific = FALSE),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . , name = "Candidates", breaks = NULL, labels = NULL))

```
