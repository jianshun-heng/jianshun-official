# California Contributors plots

In this exercise, I plot the amounts raised in terms of political contributions by the top 10 candidates within their respective top 10 cities in California. The data used was from the year 2016.

## Join dataframes

```{r, load_CA_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Make sure you use vroom() as it is significantly faster than read.csv()
# Load datasets
CA_contributors_2016 <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data","CA_contributors_2016.csv"))

zipcodes <- read_csv(here::here("data", "zip_code_database.csv"))

# Glimpse datasets
glimpse(CA_contributors_2016)
glimpse(zipcodes)

# Join datasets (note that zip types are different across both datasets)
# Therefore we change them to be the same so that the datasets can be joined
CA_contributors_2016$zip<-as.character(CA_contributors_2016$zip)
df <- left_join(CA_contributors_2016, zipcodes, "zip")
```

## Create summary statistics

```{r, create summary statistics}
# Summarise total contributions raised by the top 10 candidates across every city
top_10_cand_overall <- df %>% 
  group_by(cand_nm) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contb_receipt_amt)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  top_n(10)

# Create long form data to incude only the top 10 candidates
long_form_top10_cand_all_cities <- df %>% 
  filter(cand_nm %in% top_10_cand_overall$cand_nm) %>% 
  group_by(cand_nm, primary_city) %>%
  summarise(total_contrib = sum(contb_receipt_amt))

# From previous dataset, create a table for the top 10 candidates across the top 10 cities
# Incorporate the use of reorder_within to reorder within a group
top_10_cities_per_cand <- long_form_top10_cand_all_cities %>% 
  group_by(cand_nm) %>% 
  top_n(10, total_contrib) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(cand_nm = as.factor(cand_nm),
         primary_city = tidytext::reorder_within(primary_city, total_contrib, cand_nm)) 


```

## Plot political contributions raised by top 10 candidates in top 10 cities

```{r plot data}
# Plot faceted plots for each of the top 10 candidates across their respective top 10 cities
ggplot(top_10_cities_per_cand , aes(total_contrib, primary_city))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = cand_nm), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ cand_nm, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  tidytext::scale_y_reordered() +
  labs(title = "Comparisonn of contribution amounts raised", subtitle = "In which cities did the top 10 candidates raise the most money?", x = "Amount raised", y = "City") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
          axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
          strip.text = element_text(size = 5),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill="lightblue", colour="black", size=1))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = ~ format(.x, scientific = FALSE),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . , name = "Candidates", breaks = NULL, labels = NULL))

```
