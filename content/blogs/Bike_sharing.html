<h1>Excess rentals in London TfL bike sharing</h1>
<p>Here, I use data from London’s transport hub, TfL.</p>

<p>In this example, I first use the mean to calculate expected rentals . In
this case, I wanted to smooth (by averaging) all of the data, including
anomalies, across the years for rentals within each month/week; this
gives a clearer picture of an “average” for each time period since the
median statistic would automatically exclude the effects of outliers.</p>
<div id="plot-monthly-rental-faceted-by-year" class="section level2">
<h2>Plot monthly rental faceted by year</h2>
<p>I first create a mean expected rental from years 2016 to 2019 as
reference. I then tabulate bicycle rentals from 2020 to 2022 to see how
monthly bike rentals have changed since the onset of coronavirus.</p>

<p><u><strong>Observation:</strong></u></p>
<p>We see that during the beginning of coronavirus lockdown periods, we
observed a notable reduction in bike rentals. Conversely, past the
lifting of general coronavirus measures in mid 2021, we have seen
consistent positive excess rentals compared to the mean 2016-2019 bike
rentals; this suggests that the local population was particularly
inclined to get out of the house and into the fresh air by cycling more
regularly. A similar pattern can be observed for the weekly analysis of
bike rentals; bike rentals by more than 50%, as compared to the period
from 2016-2019, in most weeks after the lockdown measures were lifted.</p>
