<div id="climate-change-and-temperature-anomalies" class="section level1">
<h1>Climate change and temperature anomalies</h1>
<p>If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the <em>Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies</em> in the
Northern Hemisphere at <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp">NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space
Studies</a>. The <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt">tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here</a></p>
<p>To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base,
period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.</p>
<p>Run the code below to load the file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weather &lt;- 
  read_csv(&quot;https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv&quot;, 
           skip = 1, 
           na = &quot;***&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: <code>skip</code> and
<code>na</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>skip=1</code> option is there as the real data table only starts in
Row 2, so we need to skip one row.</li>
<li><code>na = "***"</code> option informs R how missing observations in the
spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see
that missing data is coded as “***”. It is best to specify this
here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric
data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled <code>weather</code>
in the <code>Environment</code> panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the
top-right), go to <code>Tools</code> &gt; <code>Global Options</code> &gt; <code>Pane Layout</code> and tick
the checkbox next to <code>Environment</code>. Click on the <code>weather</code> object, and
the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.</p>
<p>For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide
format.</p>
<p>You have two objectives in this section:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Select the year and the twelve month variables from the <code>weather</code>
dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this
assignment. Hint: use <code>select()</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert the dataframe from wide to ‘long’ format. Hint: use
<code>gather()</code> or <code>pivot_longer()</code> function. Name the new dataframe as
<code>tidyweather</code>, name the variable containing the name of the month as
<code>month</code>, and the temperature deviation values as <code>delta</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Create tidyweather data
tidyweather &lt;- weather %&gt;% 
  select(-c(&quot;J-D&quot;, &quot;D-N&quot;, &quot;DJF&quot;, &quot;JJA&quot;, &quot;MAM&quot;, &quot;SON&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = &quot;month&quot;, values_to = &quot;delta&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>year,</li>
<li>month, and</li>
<li>delta, or temperature deviation.</li>
</ol>
<div id="plotting-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting Information</h2>
<p>Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a
trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called
<code>date</code> in order to ensure that the <code>delta</code> values are plot
chronologically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following chunk of code, I used the <code>eval=FALSE</code> argument,
which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the
document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe
<code>tidyweather</code>. When you actually want to run this code and knit your
document, you must delete <code>eval=FALSE</code>, <strong>not just here but in all
chunks were <code>eval=FALSE</code> appears.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code># Set date format tidyweather data
tidyweather &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, &quot;1&quot;)),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

# Plot weather anomalies
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color=&quot;red&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Weather Anomalies&quot;
  )</code></pre>

<p>Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?
Use <code>facet_wrap()</code> to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month,
again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels;
that is, each month should be labeled “Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar” (full or
abbreviated month names are fine), not <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>.</p>
<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong></u></p>
<p>The effect of increasing temperature is more pronounced in the winter
months - starting from the end of fall until the start of spring. We see
this from the higher values within the winter months over the other
months across time. This reflects the effects of global warming/climate
change throughout the last decade.</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/Global_warming_files/figure-html/facet_wrap-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes
a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called <code>comparison</code> that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.</p>
<p>We remove data before 1800 and before using <code>filter</code>. Then, we use the
<code>mutate</code> function to create a new variable <code>interval</code> which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using <code>case_when()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Assign periods
comparison &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;% 
  filter(Year&gt;= 1881) %&gt;%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable &#39;interval&#39;, and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ &quot;1881-1920&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ &quot;1921-1950&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ &quot;1951-1980&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ &quot;1981-2010&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;2011-present&quot;
  ))</code></pre>
<p>Inspect the <code>comparison</code> dataframe by clicking on it in the
<code>Environment</code> pane.</p>
<p>Now that we have the <code>interval</code> variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (<code>delta</code>), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set <code>fill</code> to
<code>interval</code> to group and colour the data by different time periods.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create density plot of monthly deviation based off each interval period
ggplot(comparison, aes(delta, fill = interval, alpha = 0.1)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = &quot;Denisty plots of monthly deviations&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Separated by Intervals&quot;, x = &quot;Delta&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/Global_warming_files/figure-html/density_plot-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><u><strong>NOTE:</strong></u></p>
<p>From 1881 until 1980, we did not observe huge anomalies in terms of
temperature delta from the base period (1951-1980). However, this was
not reflected past 1980; temperatures began rising more drastically from
1981-present. More strikingly, the average delta for the last period is
around 0.5 higher than that of the previous period (1981-2010). This
hints at even higher average deviations in future that come faster
unless a downward pressure is exerted on temperature increases through
climate change measures.</p>
<p>So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
<code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarise()</code>, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly &lt;- comparison %&gt;%
  group_by(Year) %&gt;% 
  summarise(mean_delta_year = mean(delta))

# plot mean annual delta across years:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x = Year, y= mean_delta_year)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(colour = &quot;red&quot;, method = &quot;loess&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Yearly Weather Anomalies&quot;,
    y = &quot;Mean annual delta&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/Global_warming_files/figure-html/averaging-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
#change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot</code></pre>
<p><u><strong>NOTE:</strong></u></p>
<p>Like what we were hinting at earlier, the yearly anomalies over the past
4 decades (starting from 1980) have followed a relatively exponential
upward trend. During the 1980s, the average yearly delta was between 0
and 0.5 whereas this average has climbed past 1.5 in the most recent
years. This increase of 1 degree overall has not been witnessed in the
century prior to 1980, thus emphasising the magnitude of the rapidly
worsening global warming phenomenon.</p>

<div id="confidence-interval-for-delta" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence Interval for <code>delta</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php">NASA points out on their
website</a>
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast
amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that
much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge
the Earth into the Little Ice Age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual
delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation
with the <code>infer</code> package. Recall that the dataframe <code>comparison</code> has
already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we
are only interested in what is happening between 2011-present.</p>

<p>What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and
outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and
the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong></u></p>
<p>The results give an interesting insight into the sea and land
temperature differences during the 2011 - present time interval. The
mean of the temperature delta is around 1.06 degrees. By means of a
confidence interval calculation we can state with 95% certainty that the
mean temperature delta is between 1.02 and 1.11 degrees for this time
period. As there is no underlying distribution, we used the t-statistics
and a degrees of freedom of n-1 to calculate the critical values
required for a confidence interval calculation. We confirmed this
estimate by using a bootstrapping method that manually created the
confidence intervals and provided a lower bound of 1.02 degrees and a
upper bound of 1.11 degrees.</p>
